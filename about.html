                <h2>The Brand &raquo;</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Tailory New York is an appointment only custom clothing company that combines the modernity of Fashion Design with the heritage art of Custom Tailoring. We are unique in that we cater to both the Men and Women market.
                    </p>
                <h2>The Concept &raquo;</h2>
                    <p>
                        Providing personally designed, fitted and curated collections for each individual client is the essence of who we are. At The Tailory New York, we believe that your wardrobe should not only fit perfectly, but should be designed with only YOU in mind. The end result?—clients get the best of both worlds, impeccable custom fit and custom designed pieces that works seamlessly with their lifestyle.
                    </p>
                <h2>A Note From the Founder &raquo; </h2>
                    <p>
                        The idea for The Tailory New York began when I decided to direct my years of fashion design and men’s tailoring experience towards my own wardrobe. As a pant suit aficionado and a lover of men’s fashion and tailoring, I was always drawn to tailored clothing and strived to create fashion that conveyed the same message of confidence that a perfectly custom tailored suit did for men. Style icons like Sean Connery and Cary Grant, as well as modern day 007 Daniel Craig (shaken not stirred) were always my style inspirations. To me, they are the epitome of refinement and sophistication, true gentlemen in style.
                        My passion for fashion and tailoring led me through the Fashion Design program at Parsons followed by stints in custom tailoring, fashion design, fashion styling and brand development. But the more I integrated myself in the industry, the more I realized that impeccable fit, for men and women, was almost impossible to find in ready to wear clothing. So, I launched The Tailory New York, a way for me to combine my two passions, Fashion Design and Custom Tailoring. Everyone wants to look their best and having a wardrobe curated to your body and lifestyle not only enables you to look your best but makes you feel your best.
                        At The Tailory New York, “we believe that your wardrobe should not only fit perfectly, but should be designed with only YOU in mind.” Providing personally designed, fitted and curated collections for each individual client is the essence of who we are. Let us curate and design the wardrobe fit for YOU! </br>

                        Sincerely,</br>
                        Shao Yang, Founder 
                        <br> </br>
